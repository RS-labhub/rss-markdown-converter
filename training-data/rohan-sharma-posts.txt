𝗡𝗼 𝗮𝗱𝘀. 𝗡𝗼 𝗽𝗶𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗲𝘀. 𝗝𝘂𝘀𝘁 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗸 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗹 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝘀.

Yesterday’s 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗔𝗻𝗼𝗻𝘆𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘀 was one of those “you had to be there” moments.

We had lightning demos from open-source tinkerers, honest convos about burnout, and a late-night voice channel that somehow turned into a debugging support group. This is what it looks like when community actually means something.

At devEco, we host these casual monthly meetups so devs can share what they’re building, ask for help, or just hang out with folks who get it. No pressure. No ego. Just curiosity, camaraderie, and code.

If that sounds like your kind of space, come say hey on Discord.

We’re building this collective with each other, not for an audience.

Yesterday’s session brought crispy talks, good vibes, and some playful roasting. I couldn’t stay for the whole thing (work called), but the part I caught? Totally worth it.

Hearing from folks with serious industry experience and just being able to talk like humans reminds me why devEco feels different.

Hey all,

Recently, I removed all the unknown connections from my LinkedIn account. But even before I didn't have 500+ connections, it was only 156, and now it's only 133.

I never wanted a big LinkedIn family with 99% unknown faces. Those are not connections, but just numbers.

The unknown connections I removed were:
- the people I never met/talk/know
- my classmates (personal reasons.)

What's your thought on this?

Hey there,

It's been a long time since I participated in a hackathon (almost after 2 yrs) or created a project.

Let's ship some stuff!!!

Created 𝐑𝐚𝐝𝐡𝐢𝐤𝐚'𝐬 𝐀𝐈 𝐃𝐨𝐜𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐠𝐞𝐫: 𝑨 𝒔𝒖𝒑𝒆𝒓 𝒑𝒐𝒘𝒆𝒓𝒇𝒖𝒍 𝑫𝒐𝒄𝒖𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑴𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒈𝒆𝒎𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝑺𝒚𝒔𝒕𝒆𝒎.

This project demonstrates how to implement fine-grained authorization for both users and AI agents in a Next.js application using Permit.io. It's a document management system where users can create, view, edit, and delete documents based on their roles and document ownership, and AI agents can assist with document management based on their assigned permissions.

Configu Hacktoberfest ✅

This year, I didn't contribute to many organizations during Hacktoberfest. I contributed mostly to Mattermost, Configu, and KitOps.

This is a recap of the Configu Hacktoberfest Journey.

Configu is an open-source, end-to-end ConfigOps infrastructure that empowers engineering teams to seamlessly manage and collaborate on software configuration data—such as environment variables, secrets, and feature flags—across any system or environment.

I contributed mostly to the documentation part, and here are my PRs links:
1. https://lnkd.in/ggP2jhBM
2. https://lnkd.in/g8nbV_T2
3. https://lnkd.in/ggM7mJce

Star Configu on GitHub: https://lnkd.in/ggKNVbhd ⭐

Do you want swags too? But Hackotberfest is over... No worries, you don't have to wait for next year.

Contribute to Configu: https://lnkd.in/gjPnifHV and get swag credits for their official swag store! 🎉

(In love with the Drinking Glass and I just realized it's Bella + Canvas tee. 🐦‍🔥)
