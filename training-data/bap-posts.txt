I've been exploring some tools that are making waves in the AI development space, and I wanted to share these:

• Kiro: If you struggled to keep up with your agent workflows, Kiro brings a spec-first philosophy (something I write a little about at the AI Native Dev), helping you structure your requirements and design from the start. 

They're back on their waitlist: kiro.dev

• Vibetunnel: Fun tool to manage multiple Claude sessions. This orchestration shell lets you handle multiple sessions and scale your tools efficiently. 

• Claude Code Usage Monitor: Every token counts, and keeping track of your costs in real-time to never get surprised by development expenses. Perfect for watching your budget while scaling your development.

What tools are you using in your AI development stack?

GitHub's MCP Server: 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐜𝐚𝐧 𝐧𝐨𝐰 𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐤 𝐭𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐫𝐞𝐩𝐨𝐬.

Instead of flipping between tabs, you can ask Copilot to "list open PRs touching the payment module" and get an answer on the spot.

Under the hood sits a new Go-based MCP server, the first official bridge between agents and GitHub's own APIs.

Key touches:
• get_me for plain-language queries.
• Custom tool descriptions to limit what an agent touches.
• Native support in VS Code.

The pattern feels familiar: more context for the AI, fewer detours for the developer, with a manual review as the last step.

You can find the full news with what happened, how the community is responding, and how the folks at the AI Native Dev are thinking about it:

GitHub Unveils Copilot Coding Agent at Build 2025

Ask directly on GitHub, "Refactor this query into its own class," and it creates a branch, drafts a pull request, then waits for your review (CI checks and branch rules still in place).

Early testers note it shines on low-level chores, letting humans stay on design work.

A few patterns stand out:
• PR drafts run off-editor, sharing logs so you can trace every step.
• MCP hooks mean the agent can tap other tools or data without much hand holding.
• Clear acceptance criteria and solid tests seem to raise the quality of its output.

Some devs are questioning what this means for junior talent (rightly so) or secret keys slipping into commits, which suggests careful prompts and tight safeguards will matter.

The Model Context Protocol is reshaping how we think about agent orchestration.

Instead of rigid pipelines, we're moving toward flexible context sharing between specialized agents. Each agent maintains its domain expertise while contributing to a larger collaborative intelligence.

This reminds me of the early days of microservices - the promise of composable, scalable systems. But unlike microservices, MCP enables semantic interoperability. Agents don't just exchange data; they share understanding.

The implications for development teams are profound:
• Reduced integration overhead between AI tools
• More granular control over agent capabilities  
• Better debugging and observability across agent interactions

What patterns are you seeing emerge in your agent workflows?

---

Behind every successful AI implementation, there's usually a developer who spent weeks debugging the prompt engineering.

The gap between "AI can do this" and "AI reliably does this in production" remains surprisingly wide. We're still in the era of artisanal prompt crafting.

Some patterns I've noticed in teams scaling AI effectively:

• They version control their prompts like code
• They instrument everything - token usage, response quality, latency
• They build robust fallback mechanisms for when models hallucinate
• They invest heavily in evaluation frameworks

The tooling is getting better, but the fundamentals of software engineering discipline still apply. Maybe more so.

---

Fast follow-up on the MCP discussion: the protocol specification matters less than the ecosystem it enables.

We're seeing specialized connectors emerge for everything from database queries to image generation. The real value isn't in the protocol itself - it's in the composability.

Think about how Docker didn't just standardize containers; it created an ecosystem where complex applications could be assembled from simple, reliable components.

MCP feels similar. We're moving from monolithic AI applications to compositional intelligence architectures.

Early adopters are already seeing benefits:
• Faster iteration cycles on agent capabilities
• Better testing and validation of individual components
• Cleaner separation of concerns between different AI functions

The abstraction layer is finally emerging.

---

The hardest part about building with AI isn't the technology - it's the product decisions.

When Claude can generate a full feature in minutes, the bottleneck shifts to knowing what to build. Product sense becomes the scarce resource.

Teams that excel at AI-native development share a common trait: they're exceptional at rapid experimentation. They can quickly validate whether an AI-generated solution actually solves the user's problem.

This requires new muscles:
• Faster hypothesis formation and testing
• Better mechanisms for collecting user feedback
• More sophisticated A/B testing frameworks
• Cleaner ways to measure value delivered vs. complexity added

The technical barriers are dropping fast. The product strategy barriers are just getting started.

---

Three-month retrospective on our MCP implementation:

What worked:
• Context sharing between agents reduced our debugging time by ~40%
• Modular agent design made it easier to swap out underperforming models
• Better observability into agent decision-making processes

What didn't:
• Initial setup complexity was higher than expected
• Some agents developed subtle dependencies that weren't immediately obvious
• Performance overhead from context serialization in high-frequency scenarios

Key learning: treat MCP like any other architectural decision. The abstraction has costs and benefits. Measure both.

Would we do it again? Absolutely. But with better upfront planning around agent boundaries and interaction patterns.

---

Developer experience is becoming the primary differentiator in AI tooling.

It's not enough for an AI model to be capable - it needs to integrate seamlessly into existing workflows. The best AI tools feel like natural extensions of how developers already work.

Recent examples that get this right:
• GitHub Copilot's inline suggestions vs. separate chat interfaces
• Cursor's contextual code generation vs. generic coding assistants  
• V0's component-aware generation vs. generic HTML output

The pattern: AI that understands the developer's context and intent, not just their explicit request.

This raises interesting questions about tool design. Should AI be invisible (augmenting existing tools) or explicit (new interfaces optimized for AI interaction)?

My take: both have their place, but invisible integration wins for frequently-used workflows.

---

The conversation around AI replacing developers misses the more interesting shift happening: AI is changing what it means to be a good developer.

Reading code becomes more important than writing it. Understanding system architecture matters more than memorizing syntax. Product intuition becomes as valuable as technical skills.

This isn't unique to software. Every field touched by automation goes through this evolution. The valuable skills shift from execution to judgment.

For developers, this means:
• Focus on learning patterns, not just languages
• Invest in understanding user needs and business context
• Develop taste for good system design and architecture
• Build strong debugging and reasoning skills

The code will write itself. The thinking won't.

---

Prompt engineering is starting to feel like the CSS of AI development - everyone thinks they can do it until they try to do it well.

The gap between basic prompting and production-ready prompt engineering is enormous. It requires understanding model behaviors, edge cases, and systematic approaches to reliability.

Some hard-learned lessons:
• Prompts need versioning and testing infrastructure
• Examples in prompts are worth 10x more than instructions
• Temperature settings matter more than most people realize
• Chain-of-thought reasoning helps, but adds latency and cost

We're still in the early stages of understanding best practices. The tooling is improving, but the fundamentals require discipline and systematic thinking.

Treat your prompts like code. Because they are.

---

The most underrated skill in AI development: knowing when not to use AI.

Not every problem needs a large language model. Sometimes a simple heuristic, database query, or traditional algorithm is faster, cheaper, and more reliable.

AI natives understand this intuitively. They reach for AI when it adds genuine value, not because it's the shiny new tool.

This judgment comes from experience - building enough AI applications to understand where the technology excels and where it struggles.

The best AI developers I know spend as much time simplifying problems as they do implementing solutions.

---

Model Context Protocol adoption update: we're seeing interesting patterns emerge in how teams structure their agent ecosystems.

Successful implementations tend to follow a hub-and-spoke model rather than peer-to-peer networks. One central orchestrator manages context flow between specialized agents.

This reduces complexity and makes debugging much more manageable. It also provides a natural place to implement quality controls and monitoring.

The trade-off is potential bottlenecks in the central coordinator, but most teams find this preferable to the complexity of fully distributed agent networks.

Architecture patterns from distributed systems apply surprisingly well to agent coordination.

---

AI-native development is forcing us to rethink our relationship with uncertainty.

Traditional software development aims for predictability. Given the same inputs, the system should produce the same outputs. AI systems are fundamentally probabilistic.

This creates new challenges:
• How do you test non-deterministic systems?
• What does "correctness" mean when outputs vary?
• How do you debug probabilistic failures?

Teams adapting well are borrowing concepts from other domains that deal with uncertainty - statistics, control theory, experimental design.

The mindset shift is significant. We're moving from engineering deterministic systems to managing probabilistic ones.

---

The infrastructure requirements for AI-native applications are becoming clearer:

• Vector databases for semantic search and retrieval
• Model serving infrastructure that can handle variable load
• Monitoring and observability tools that understand AI-specific metrics
• Cost tracking and optimization for token usage
• A/B testing frameworks that account for model variability

This is creating a new category of developer tools. The companies building this infrastructure will likely be as important as the model providers themselves.

We're still early in this ecosystem development. There's room for significant innovation in tooling and platforms.

---

One year into serious AI-native development, and the biggest surprise has been how much it feels like the early days of mobile development.

Similar patterns: rapid technological change, unclear best practices, lots of experimentation, and a gold rush mentality.

Also similar: the winners will be those who focus on user problems rather than just technical capabilities.

The technology is fascinating, but the product opportunities are what drive adoption. We're moving from "look what AI can do" to "here's how AI solves your problem."

This maturation process typically takes 3-5 years. We're probably halfway through it.

---

Recent developments in agent frameworks have me thinking about the evolution of software architecture patterns.

We went from monoliths to microservices to serverless. Now we're moving toward agent-oriented architectures where intelligent components coordinate to solve complex problems.

The parallels to previous architectural shifts are striking:
• Similar promises of modularity and composability  
• Similar challenges around coordination and consistency
• Similar learning curves for teams adopting the new patterns

The difference: agents can adapt and learn, which adds new dimensions to system behavior.

Early adopters are developing new patterns for agent coordination, monitoring, and governance. These patterns will likely become standard architectural knowledge in the next few years.

Windsurf just made Cursor look expensive

We are in a free-tier war for AI coding IDE tools, including incumbents like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf and more. 

Windsurf is providing GPT 4.1 (OpenAI's best coding model) with 5 times more free credits, as well as unlimited completions —something the competition doesn't do just yet. If you are an AI explorer, a developer or a junior developer, this is an interesting opportunity to play around with Windsurf. 

More importantly, Openai decided to acquire Windsurf. 

• Maybe Windsurf gets access to cheaper or better models? 
• Will it be better to develop software using this IDE? 
• Should you commit to Windsurf already? 

Keeping up with this space is challenging—upskilling is even more so. 

This is why our team (Sam Hepburn, Simon Maple, Patrick Debois, Dion Almaer) is organising a free virtual 1-day event on May 13th:

• Proven agentic workflows from Netlify, JetBrains, Qodo and more
• Live walkthroughs of code generation
• Templates that slash iteration time and ship multimodal models faster

AI NativeDevCon is a conference 𝐛𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐭 𝐛𝐲 𝐀𝐈 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐫𝐬, 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐀𝐈 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐞𝐫𝐬.

Lovable flipped the switch on 2.0. But is it the Visual Basic of the AI era?

𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭'𝐬 𝐧𝐞𝐰:
• Chat Mode Agent hunts files, queries DBs, and debugs on cue
• Real-time Multiplayer for better collabs (pairs on Pro, squadrons on Teams)
• Instant deploy with custom domains baked in (no more DNS set ups!)
• Increased code security, plus a freer-range Dev Mode

That said, early Reddit threads are flagging concerns (mostly around code quality) with some wondering if Lovable might've traded performance for cost savings.

Zooming out, it's part of a bigger pattern: each wave of abstraction in tech history (think assembly -> Python -> serverless) opens the door to more builders. 

Lovable's abstraction and optional control is a familiar trend in dev evolution, and one that's set to accelerate with AI-native platforms.

For anyone curious about fast prototyping or exploring agent workflows, Lovable 2.0 looks like it's worth a spin (but with eyes open!).

It seems Windsurf is quietly resetting what "free" means for an AI IDE.

The refreshed plan gives room to tinker without opening the wallet.

• ~100 GPT-4.1 / o4-mini prompts a month (25 credits)
• Unlimited Cascade + tab completions
• Live preview and one app deploy per day

All of that sits behind a single prompt-meter, so usage stays visible even when the agent branches out.

For students and cost-watching devs, it looks like a neat sandbox for training and experimenting.

The offer also nudges Copilot and Cursor to raise the bar or watch users wander.

OpenAI's acquisition adds a twist. Could the price of experimentation drop even further? Exclusive access to models? 

Either way, keeping Windsurf in your rotation seems like a low-risk hedge while the free-tier contest unfolds.

GPT 4.1 exposes frustrations in AI native development—despite the hype around its release.

Why? ⬇️

Benchmarks are supposed to help, but right now, they're causing confusion. 

GPT-4.1 might outperform its predecessors on SWE-bench but stumble elsewhere (especially in front of Gemini and Claude).

It's a reminder: benchmarks aren't the full story; real-world applicability matters more.

Developers are also tired of juggling fragmented model features and inconsistent APIs.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐈 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐰𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝 𝐟𝐞𝐞𝐥𝐬 𝐚 𝐛𝐢𝐭 𝐥𝐢𝐤𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐲 𝐰𝐞𝐛 𝐝𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐩𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭, 𝐰𝐡𝐞𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐲 𝐛𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐬𝐞𝐫 𝐡𝐚𝐝 𝐢𝐭𝐬 𝐨𝐰𝐧 𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐫𝐤𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐜𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐧𝐞𝐞𝐝𝐬.

What devs really want is simplicity—abstraction layers that handle multi-model complexities for them.

It's not just about the "latest and greatest" model; it's about practical integration and cost-effective performance.

The future is moving from manual model picking toward intelligent, automatic infrastructure.

Less guesswork, more building.

If you're feeling the "model maze" frustration, you're not alone.
